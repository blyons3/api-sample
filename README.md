# Read Me First
This Project was built using Java 17 and Maven.
I utilized the Spring Initializer as a starting point.
It was built by Bill Lyons for a Homework Assignment.

# Getting Started
Postman Tests shared via 
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/22600928/2s93Xu3Rgt

I have tests that demonstrate querying customers, purchase transactions, and 
a query for points by customer by month and year.

### Reference Documentation

Assignment email and API Homework Document included for reference.
I did leave a ToDo.txt in the documentation area.  Typically, each ToDo 
would be opened as separate issues in GitHub or Jira.

### Guides
The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)
